# Population and Sample

## Population

A population refers to the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about.

* It includes all members or observations of a defined group.
* It can be both discrete or continuous numerical data

### Examples

* All voters in Canada
* Every product coming off a factory line
* All high school students in Ontario

Studying and analyzing the data from the entire population would provide the best representation; however, it is often too large to measure and study as a whole.

## Sample

A **sample** is a **subset** (a smaller portion) of the _population_ that is selected for analysis.

Samples are used when it is impractical or impossible to study the entire population.

A good sample can help describe the entire population; however, a bad sample can create incorrect conclusion, stereotypes, and bias. Therefore, proper sampling methods must be used.

### Examples

* 1,000 Canadian voters surveyed before an election
* 50 students randomly selected from a school
* 20 products checked for quality control
