# AGGREGATE Queries

Aggregate queries in SQL use aggregate functions to perform calculations on a set of values, returning a single value.

The common queries we will use are the following:

* **`COUNT()`**: Returns the number of rows.
* **`SUM()`**: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
* **`AVG()`**: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
* **`MIN()`**: Returns the smallest value in a column.
* **`MAX()`**: Returns the largest value in a column
