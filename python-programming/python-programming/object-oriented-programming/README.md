**Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**

* Programming practice to design modular reusable software systems
* OOP designs programs with creation of Objects
* An approach that focuses on the definition of data rather than the input ‚Üí processing ‚Üí output logic (OOP vs procedure-oriented programming)
* The goal is to create an object that we can define and provide functionality to solve problems

{% hint style="info" %}
‚ÄúOOP focuses on how to _**manipulate the data of the object**_ rather than the logic required to manipulate them‚Äù
{% endhint %}

## Procedural vs OOP

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Procedural Programming" %}
Focuses on

* Calculations
* Logical Evaluations
* Complete Repetitive tasks
* Databases
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="OOP" %}
How to describe the data:

_Example: A human_

* What‚Äôs their name?
* What‚Äôs their address?
* What functions can this object have?
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Object:** A combination of data and functional code. This is because real-world objects have states and behaviour.

**States:** The characteristic, Measurable data of an object

**Behaviour:** The available functionality of the object (what can it do?)
