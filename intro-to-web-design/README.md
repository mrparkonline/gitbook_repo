# üõ†Ô∏è Intro to Web Design

Web design relies on three core technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Each plays a unique role in creating and enhancing web pages:

1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**:
   * **Structure**: HTML is the backbone of any web page. It defines the structure and layout by using various elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.
   * **Content**: It allows you to embed content such as text, images, videos, and forms.
2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**:
   * **Styling**: CSS is used to control the presentation of the HTML elements. It defines the look and feel of the web page, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.
   * **Responsive Design**: CSS helps in making web pages responsive, ensuring they look good on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
3. **JavaScript**:
   * **Interactivity**: JavaScript adds interactivity to web pages. It allows you to create dynamic content, such as interactive forms, animations, and real-time updates.
   * **Functionality**: It can manipulate HTML and CSS, handle events (like clicks and key presses), and communicate with servers to fetch or send data without reloading the page.

Together, these technologies enable web designers to create visually appealing, interactive, and user-friendly websites.
