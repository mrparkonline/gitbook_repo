# Quantitative Data

Numerical (Quantitative) Data can be categorized into two types: _discrete_  and _continuous_

When data collects information to collect answers from questions with the likes of:

* How many?
* How much?
* How often?

We often use quantitative data to answer such questions.

## Discrete Numerical Data

Discrete means "countable". Each data point cannot be made any more precise with decimals or fractions.&#x20;

Discrete numerical data will use **integer values**.

### Examples of discrete numerical data

* Number of students in a class (e.g., 23 students)
* Number of cars in a parking lot
* Number of goals scored in a match
* Shoe size (often treated as discrete though it has decimal-like steps)

## Continuous Numerical Data

Continuous numerical data represents measurable quantities that can take any value within a range, including fractions and decimals.

Continuous numerical data is used often for measurement where precision of decimal or fractions are required.

### Examples of continuous numerical data

* Height of a person (e.g., 170.5 cm)
* Weight of a package (e.g., 12.75 kg)
* Temperature (e.g., 36.6Â°C)
* Time taken to complete a race (e.g., 9.58 seconds)
