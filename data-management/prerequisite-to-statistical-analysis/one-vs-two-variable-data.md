# One vs Two Variable Data

## What is a variable?

A characteristic that can change or vary between participants/records.

## One Variable / Single Variable Data

A dataset or a single column from a dataset  where each item has only one characteristic (_variable)_ being measured or observed.

This list above is a fictional dataset containing an Football player's height, weight, their 40 yard run time in seconds and their vertical jump height in inches.

Each columns of height, weight, 40 yard dash time and vertical jump height can be studied individually as **One Variable Data.**

### Example

Given the 10 player's 40-yard dash data, we can study and analyze as it one variable data analysis.

We could look at things like:

* Slowest and Fastest Player
* Average time elapsed between the 10 players

## Two Variable Data

_Can be called **bivariate data**_

Data where each item has two characteristics (variables) measured at the same time.

* We often use two variable data to find **relationship or associations** between the variables

| Player Name            | Height (cm) | 40-Yard Dash (s) |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Marcus “Tank” Doyle    | 198         | 4.78             |
| DeShawn Rivers         | 185         | 4.41             |
| Blake Armstrong        | 191         | 4.54             |
| Jamal “Jet” Carter     | 178         | 4.29             |
| Trevor McKnight        | 195         | 4.65             |
| Andre Lopez            | 183         | 4.50             |
| Colton “Crusher” Hayes | 200         | 4.89             |
| Malik Jefferson        | 188         | 4.42             |
| Jared “Lightning” Cole | 180         | 4.31             |
| Ethan Brooks           | 193         | 4.60             |

The dataset we have seen prior has been shrunk down, but also arranged so that we are creating a two variable dataset.

This table can be used to study the relationship between a player's height and their 40-yard dash speed.
