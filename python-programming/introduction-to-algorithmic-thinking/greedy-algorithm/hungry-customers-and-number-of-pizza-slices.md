## Story

Once upon a time, there was a popular pizza store that was famous for its delicious pizzas, each baked with love and topped with the freshest ingredients. One evening near closing time, a crowd of hungry customers gathered, each with a specific hunger level, measured in the number of slices they needed to feel satisfied.

The customers and their hungry values were as follows:

```python
customers = {
    "Alice": 3,
    "Bob": 2,
    "Charlie": 5,
    "Diana": 4
}

# Each customerâ€™s name to how many slices they needed to satisfy their appetite.
```

Behind the counter, the owner kept a record of the types of pizzas available, each with a limited number of slices:

```python
pizzas = {
    "Margherita": 6,
    "Pepperoni": 5,
}
```

## With the given data, what is the maximum number of customers that you can serve to satisfy their pizza craving?
