## What is a programming editor?

A programming editor is usually a software that allows a programmer to write programs.

### What is _Programiz?_

[_Programiz_](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/) is a web application that allows any programmers to write simple programs by using an internet browser.

## Our Recommended Workflow

_Workflow is a guided process of how a programmer should work._

1. Code JavaScript on Programiz
2. Test and Run your code on Programiz
3. Copy and Paste your JavaScript into an external JavaScript file onto your personal computer
4. Name the file with a `.js` extension (example: `firstProgram.js`)
   1. The filename should be short and meaningful
   2. The first letter should be lowercased and not a numeric digit
   3. There should be no special characters except an underscore (\_)
   4. You should not use a period (`.`) unless you are specifying the extension
5. Upload the file in an organized folder within your Google Drive Folder for this class
