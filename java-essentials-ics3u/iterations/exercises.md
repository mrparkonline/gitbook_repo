1. **Factorial Calculation:**&#x20;

Create two programs that calculates the factorial of a given integer. The first solution should have a while loop; the other solution should use a for loop

{% hint style="info" %}
The factorial function `(symbol: !)` says to multiply all whole numbers from our chosen number down to 1.

**Examples:**

* `4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24`&#x20;
* `7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040`&#x20;
* `1! = 1`
{% endhint %}
