# JavaScript Exercise Set 2

## Programming Questions

### Q1) Average Checker

Given four values from the user, determine if they have an average of 80% or higher.

You should also check for Scholarships

* An average of 90 to 94 (inclusively) → $2000
* An average of 95 to 99 (inclusively) → $4000

### Q2) When squirrels party?

When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have acorns.&#x20;

A squirrel party is successful when the number of acorns is between 40 and 60, inclusively.&#x20;

During the weekends, there is no need for acorns. The party is always fun.&#x20;

Create a program that outputs if the party was successful depending on the user’s input.&#x20;

### Q3) Adding two values with restrictions

Create a program that adds two integer values of the user's input.&#x20;

The sum cannot be within the range of 10,20 (excluding 20); therefore, the program should output “illegal parameters” for such operands.

### Q4) Create a program to check if an integer is a perfect square.

For example:

* Input of 25 is a perfect square
* Input of 17 is not a perfect square

_You may assume that all your inputs are positive integers._

### Q5) Two Away from a Multiple of 10

Create a program such that when given a non-negative number input, output whether or not if the number is 2 away from a multiple of 10.

### Q6) Pythagorean Triples

Write a program to check if values a, b, and c are Pythagorean triples such that a^2+b^2 = c^2

* Note: First Input → a; Second Input → b; Third Input → c;
* Note: a, b, c are BAD variable names.

### Q7) Triangles

Create a program such that:

* Determine if the three side length inputs of a triangle is a valid triangle.
  * [Explanation Link](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-Three-Side-Lengths-Are-a-Triangle)
* Determine the type of the triangle given its side length (equilateral, isosceles, scalene)

### Q8) Movie Going Program

Create a program that determines what ratings of movies you can watch based on your age.

* Ages in 18+ can watch all ratings of movie
* Ages in 13 to 17 can watch all movies except a rating of R
* Ages in 0 to 12 will require parental guidance for PG-13
* All ages can enjoy G rated movies
