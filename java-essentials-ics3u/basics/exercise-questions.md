4. **Write a Program that outputs the number of paint cans needed, the number of paint cans leftover, and the total cost of the project.**&#x20;

```
Instructions:
- There are 3 inputs. One for each section of the fence.
- Each fence plank denoted by a "F" requires a single paint can
- The paint can only comes in a box of 12.

Sample Input 2:
FFFFF
FFFF
FFFFF

Sample Output 1:
14.0
10.0
29.9
