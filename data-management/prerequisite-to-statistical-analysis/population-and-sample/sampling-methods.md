# Sampling Methods

The best samples to represent a population is the one that despite being a subset of the population, the sample still accurately represents the population.

## Importance of a Good Sample

#### **Minimizing Bias**

When selection is not random, certain segments of the population may be over-represented or under-represented.&#x20;

This introduces **sampling bias**, leading to inaccurate conclusions about the population.

**Generalizability**

A representative sample allows researchers to generalize findings from the sample back to the larger population with a measurable degree of confidence. Without representativeness, the findings are only applicable to the sampled group.
