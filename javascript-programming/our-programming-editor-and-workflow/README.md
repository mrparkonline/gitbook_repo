## What is a program?

A program is a set of ordered instruction that a computer will follow. It is often written by a human programmer. Most programs are designed to execute its lines of code from top to bottom, in order.

## What is a programming editor?

A programming editor is usually a software that allows a programmer to write programs.

### What is _Programiz?_

[_Programiz_](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/) is a web application that allows any programmers to write simple programs by using an internet browser.

## Our Recommended Workflow

_Workflow is a guided process of how a programmer should work._

1. Code JavaScript on Programiz
2. Test and Run your code on Programiz
3. Copy and Paste your JavaScript into a text file on your [**Google Drive's text-editor**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/how-to-create-a-plain-text-file-in-google-drive-and-why-you-might-want-to/).
4. Name the file with a `.js` extension (example: `firstProgram.js`)
   1. The filename should be short and meaningful
   2. The first letter should be lowercased and not a numeric digit
   3. There should be no special characters except an underscore (\_)
   4. You should not use a period (`.`) unless you are specifying the extension
5. Save the file in your Google Drive Folder for this class
