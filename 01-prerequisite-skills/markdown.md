# Markdown

[**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting and structuring plain text documents. It is designed to be easy to read and write, while also being easily converted into HTML or other formats.

Markdown document files will have a file extension of `.md`
