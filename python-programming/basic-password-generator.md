### General Password Tips

#### Weak Passwords

A weak password is one that is easy to guess or crack, often due to its simplicity, common usage, or predictability. Characteristics of weak passwords include:

* **Short length**: Typically less than 8 characters.
* **Common words or sequences**: Such as "password", "123456", "qwerty", or "abc123".
* **Personal information**: Easily obtainable information like a userâ€™s name, birthdate, or phone number.
* **Lack of variety**: Using only letters, or only numbers, without mixing in other character types.

#### Strong Passwords

A strong password is designed to be difficult to guess or crack, thereby enhancing security. Characteristics of strong passwords include:

* **Long length**: Typically 12 characters or more.
* **Complexity**: A mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (examples: `@, #, $, %`).
* **Unpredictability**: Avoiding common words, phrases, and predictable patterns.
* **Uniqueness**: Different passwords for different accounts to prevent a breach on one site from compromising others.
