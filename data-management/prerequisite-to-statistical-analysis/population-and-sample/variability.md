# Variability

_Variability, Spread, Dispersion, Scatter_

## Variability

Distance between the data points that are in a dataset. It tells you how much the individual values differ from each other and from the center of the distribution.

> ### Scenario: Test Scores
>
> Two classes had an **average score of 75%**.&#x20;
>
> It could be concluded that both class performed at a similar level at similar learning.
>
> Class A had all students perform between 70% and 80%.
>
> Class B had all students perform between 40% to 100%.
>
> **Class A had less variability (or less spread) compared to Class B.**

## Importance of Variability

#### Generalizability

Low variability in a sample suggests that the sample is more representative of the population, making it easier to generalize results.&#x20;

High variability means the data points are less consistent, making it harder to make precise predictions or draw strong conclusions about the larger population.

**Ability to Understand the Data**

Knowing the variability of the dataset along with other tools help to create conclusions about the dataset.

#### Comparing Datasets

Variability allows for meaningful comparisons between different datasets, even if they have similar central tendencies.

## Applications of Variability

* **Risk Assessment (e.g., in Finance)**: In fields like finance, variability of returns is directly linked to risk. A higher variability in investment returns often indicates a higher level of risk.
* **Quality Control**: In manufacturing, low variability in product dimensions or quality is desirable, indicating consistent production.

## Common ways to measure variability

This techniques will discussed in the future chapters.

* Range
* Interquartile Range
* Variance
* Standard Deviation
