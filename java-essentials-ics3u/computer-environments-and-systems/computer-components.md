A computer is composed of many different electrical components working together. Each individual component will have their own purpose to help the user do computational work.

## Main Components

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

It is the primary component of a computer responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations for various tasks. It acts as the "brain" of the computer, interpreting and carrying out instructions from software programs.&#x20;

The CPU's main functions include data manipulation, arithmetic operations, logic comparisons, and controlling the flow of data within the computer's memory and other components. It is a critical component for the overall performance of a computer system.

### Motherboard

A motherboard is the main circuit board in a computer that connects and integrates various hardware components. It serves as a central hub, providing pathways for communication between the CPU, RAM, storage devices, graphics card, and other peripherals.

The motherboard contains essential connectors, slots, and ports that allow these components to work together.&#x20;

It also includes a BIOS or UEFI firmware that initializes the system during startup and manages hardware settings. In essence, the motherboard is the foundation upon which all other computer components are interconnected and coordinated.

### Random Access Memory (RAM)

RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a type of volatile computer memory that provides fast and temporary storage for data that the CPU is actively using.&#x20;

It allows the CPU to quickly access and manipulate information needed for running programs and tasks.&#x20;

Unlike long-term storage like hard drives or SSDs, RAM is much faster but also loses its stored data when the computer is powered off. It acts as a working space for the CPU, enabling efficient multitasking and smooth operation of applications by providing quick access to data and instructions.

### Hard Drive

A hard drive is a non-volatile storage device used in computers to store data over the long term. They are commonly used for storing the operating system, applications, files, and other data that need to be preserved even when the computer is turned off.

### Power Supply Unit (PSU)

A PSU, or Power Supply Unit, is a hardware component in a computer that converts incoming electrical power from a wall outlet into the various voltages and currents needed to operate the computer's components.&#x20;

It provides a stable and regulated power supply to the motherboard, CPU, graphics card, storage devices, and other peripherals.&#x20;

The PSU ensures that the computer receives the right amount of power to function properly and safely. It typically includes connectors for different components and ensures that the computer has the necessary power for optimal performance and reliability.

### Case / PC Enclosure

A PC case, also known as a computer case or chassis, is the enclosure that houses and protects the internal components of a personal computer.&#x20;

It's designed to accommodate the motherboard, storage drives, power supply, and other hardware components.&#x20;

The case provides structural support, airflow for cooling, and space for cable management. It often includes openings for fans or liquid cooling solutions to prevent overheating.&#x20;

Additionally, it offers external ports and slots for connecting peripherals such as monitors, keyboards, and USB devices. The case comes in various sizes and styles, catering to different build preferences and hardware requirements.

## Other Components & Peripherals

### Graphics Card (GPU)

A graphics card, also known as a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), is a specialized component in a computer that is designed to handle and accelerate graphical tasks.&#x20;

It's responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations that are displayed on a monitor. Graphics cards are crucial for gaming, graphic design, video editing, and other visually demanding applications.&#x20;

They have their own dedicated memory (VRAM) and processing power, which offloads graphical processing tasks from the computer's main CPU. This specialization allows them to handle complex calculations required for generating high-quality visuals quickly and efficiently.

### Monitor

A computer monitor is an output device that displays visual information from a computer's graphics card. It consists of a screen that shows images, videos, text, and other content generated by the computer.&#x20;

Monitors come in various sizes and resolutions, influencing the quality and clarity of what is displayed. They use technologies like LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), LED (Light Emitting Diode), or OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) to illuminate and project the visual content. Monitors are essential for interacting with a computer, as they provide a visual interface for users to view and interact with programs, applications, and the operating system.

### Mouse

A computer mouse is an input device used to control the movement of a cursor on a computer screen. It typically consists of a hand-held device with buttons and a sensor that tracks its movement.&#x20;

By moving the mouse on a flat surface, users can control the cursor's position and select items on the screen by clicking the buttons. This enables precise pointing, clicking, and dragging actions, making it an essential tool for navigating graphical interfaces, interacting with software, and performing tasks on a computer.

### Keyboard

A computer keyboard is an input device used for entering text, commands, and other inputs into a computer. It consists of a set of keys, including letters, numbers, symbols, and special function keys.&#x20;

Users press the keys to input characters and trigger specific functions or commands. The keyboard enables efficient typing, data entry, and interaction with software applications and the operating system. It's a fundamental tool for communication and control in computing environments.
