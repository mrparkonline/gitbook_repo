# Subtract each value from the target, see if the difference exists in the list

## Solution Breakdown

* Since a sum is a result of two operands added together, we can express it as -> `x + y = sum`
* By rearranging the equation, we can also express it as -> `y = sum - x`
* If we have the `sum` set to our given target value, and let `x` be represented by each individual values in our list, we can generate the `y` value
  * Each time we generate the `y` value, we can search the list if the `y` value exists in the list
  * If the value exists, the index of `x` and `y` will be our pair that generated our desired target value

### Example of looking at differences

```
list = [2,7,11,15]; target = 9

all possible differences:
    9 - 2 = 7
    9 - 7 = 2
    9 - 11 = -2
    9 - 15 = -6
```

Depending what our target value is, the sum generated by each possible pair creates such numbers. As long as the target value is one of the results `(9, 13, 17, 18, 22, 26)`, we should be able to locate the two index values that adds up to the target.

## Python Solution

```python
def twoSum(array: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    answer = []
    
    for i in range(len(nums)-1):
        diff = target - nums[i]
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] == diff:
                answer.append(i)
                answer.append(j)
                return answer

    return []
# end of twoSum()
```

## Optimizing the Solution with a Dictionary

```python
def twoSum(array: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    table = {} # Empty dictionary initialization

    # Loop 1 -> Construct a dictionary
    # Each item = (number in the list, a list of where it is located)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        current_num = nums[i]
        if current_num not in table:
            # if we haven't seen this number, add it as a key with its index as a singleton list
            table[current_num] = [i]
        else:
            # if we have sen this number before, append its index into the index list
            table[current_num].append(i)
    # end of for loop
    
    # Loop 2 -> Traverse our dictionary and find the sum pairs
    for current_num, locations in table.items():
        diff = target - current_num
        if diff in table:
            # The difference is a key/member of our dictionary
            if diff == current_num:
                # Scenario 1: the difference is equal to the current number
                if len(locations) < 2:
                    # if there were no duplicates of the same number, then we can't create a sum
                    # continue just tells python to ignore the rest of this code block and go to the next iteration
                    continue
                else:
                    # Since the same number occurs in different index locations,
                    # we can slice for the first two values
                    return locations[:2]
            else:
                # Scenario 2: the difference is not equal to the current number,
                # so we just grab index locations of each and return the index list
                index1 = locations[0]
                index2 = table[diff][0]
                return [index1, index2]
    # end of for loop
                    
    return []
# end of twoSum()
```

### Doing only a single traversal through the dictionary

```python
def twoSum(array: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
     table = {}
     
     for i in range(len(array)):
          current_num = array[i]
          diff = target - current_num
          
          if diff in table:
               return [table[diff], i]
          
          table[current_num] = i
     
     return []
```
