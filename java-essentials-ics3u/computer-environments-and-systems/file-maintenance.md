## File Naming

Having a good file name is a guaranteed way to have an organized computer. Down below are some common rules to follow when naming your files.

1. **Use Descriptive Names:** Choose names that clearly describe the file's content or purpose.
2. **Avoid Special Characters:** Use only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. Avoid spaces, symbols, and other special characters.
3. **Keep it Short:** Use concise names to make them easy to read and manage.
4. **Be Consistent:** Use a consistent naming convention for similar files or a project.
5. **Use Dates:** Add dates in a standardized format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) for version control or chronological organization.
6. **Use CamelCase or Underscores:** Separate words with camelCase (e.g., myFile.txt) or underscores (e.g., my\_file.txt) for readability.
7. **Avoid Reserved Words:** Avoid using reserved keywords or characters specific to your operating system.
8. **Consider Case Sensitivity:** Be aware of whether your file system is case-sensitive or not when using capital letters.
9. **Include File Extensions**: Append appropriate file extensions (.docx, .jpg, .pdf) to indicate the file type.
10. **Organize into Folders**: Organize files into folders to maintain a structured directory.

## Hardware Based Backups

To use an external hard drive for data backup:

1. **Connect the External Drive:** Plug your external hard drive into an available USB port on your computer.
2. **Select Backup Software**: Use built-in backup software like Windows Backup or third-party backup tools (e.g., Time Machine for Mac) to set up automated backups.
3. **Configure Backup Settings:** Choose the files and folders you want to back up and set a backup schedule (e.g., daily, weekly). Ensure the external drive is selected as the backup destination.
4. **Start Backup:** Initiate the backup process, and the software will copy your selected files to the external drive. This may take some time depending on the data size.
5. **Regularly Update Backups:** Periodically check and update your backups to ensure your data remains protected. Keep the external drive disconnected when not in use to protect against malware or data corruption.

By following these steps, you'll have a reliable backup solution using an external hard drive to safeguard your important data.

**Network-attached Storage (NAS) Drive:** NAS drives are external hard drives that can be connected to a network which allows the user to backup and automate backups by LAN.

### Analysis & Clean Up

* Disk Clean-up & Disk Defragmentation system tools help to clean space and optimize your hard drives (Don’t run disk defragmentation on SSD)
* HD Analysis Applications help us to find empty space and locate storage heavy folders.
* HD Cleaners help to remove temporary files, cookies, internet history, and unnecessary application files

**Popular Applications:**

* WinDirStat (Hard Drive Space Analyzer)
* CCleaner (Disk Cleaning Tool)

### Uninstallers

Both Windows and Macs come with built-in uninstallers; however, you can also use uninstalling applications.

Main Reason: Applications leave hidden files throughout different areas of the computer. Uninstallers will find those related files and delete them too.

**Popular:**

* **Windows:** IObit Uninstaller
* **Macs:** AppCleaner

### File Compression and Uncompression

**File Compression**: To simplify the sharing of multiple or large files, files are compressed.

To open and to create compressed files we use a system tools (Zipping Tool) or a 3rd Party Application.

**Reasons to use compression tools:**

* Compress infrequent files to take up less space
* Compress files to backup with password protections
* Open up compress files when downloaded
* Share a singular compressed file when sharing multiple files
