# Sampling Methods

The best samples to represent a population is the one that despite being a subset of the population, the sample still accurately represents the population.

## Importance of a Good Sample

#### **Minimizing Bias**

When selection is not random, certain segments of the population may be over-represented or under-represented.&#x20;

This introduces **sampling bias**, leading to inaccurate conclusions about the population.

**Generalizability**

A representative sample allows researchers to generalize findings from the sample back to the larger population with a measurable degree of confidence. Without representativeness, the findings are only applicable to the sampled group.

## Sampling Techniques

| Technique     | How it works                                                                                                              | Example                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple Random | Choose a specific number of people from the entire population randomly with equal probability                             | Putting the names of all the students in a class and drawing 10 people                                                       |
| Systematic    | Sort the population and choose people at regular intervals                                                                | All the students in a school sorted alphabetically and choose a starting point then pick at regular intervals                |
| Stratified    | Divide the sample into meaningful groups, then select from each group based on proportions                                | 1000 participants, 633 identify as women, 367 identify as men. The sample now consist of 63 to 37 (identity of women to men) |
| Cluster       | divide the population into groups, randomly choose a number of the groups, sample from each group chosen                  | From YRDSB, 10 schools were selected. All grade 9 students are asked to complete a survey.                                   |
| Convenience   | Sample is chosen based on ease of access (problematic and can create unreliable conclusions)                              | A school interviews the first 10 students they see before school starts for a student climate survey                         |
| Voluntary     | Data is only collected from people who participate (problematic as only the people who volunteer describe the population) | Voting for a new premier or prime minister in Canada                                                                         |
