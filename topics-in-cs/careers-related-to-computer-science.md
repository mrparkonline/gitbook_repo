## Differences between Similar Titles

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Programmer" %}
* A programmer is an individual who primarily writes code to implement specific functionalities or features in a software application.
* Programmers focus on translating high-level designs and requirements into actual code using programming languages.
* Their responsibilities often revolve around writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining code to ensure it performs as intended.
* Programmers typically work closely with developers and engineers to implement software solutions based on their specifications.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Software Engineer" %}
* A software engineer is someone who approaches software development with a broader perspective, emphasizing design, architecture, and scalability.
* Engineers are responsible for creating and maintaining the overall structure of software systems. They make decisions about which technologies and tools to use to ensure that the software is robust, efficient, and maintainable.
* Software engineers also consider factors like system performance, security, and reliability, and they often work on large-scale projects that require careful planning and coordination among team members.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Coder" %}
* A coder is a term often used interchangeably with programmer, but it generally implies a more narrow focus on writing code.
* Coders may excel in writing specific code snippets or scripts and may not be as involved in the broader aspects of software development, such as system architecture or project planning.
* While coders are essential for implementing specific functionalities, they may not always take on the responsibilities of software engineering or full-stack development.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Developer" %}
* A developer is a broad term that encompasses programmers, coders, and engineers, as well as other roles involved in the software development process.
* Developers can be involved in various aspects of the software development lifecycle, from initial design and coding to testing, deployment, and maintenance.
* Depending on the context, a developer may be a front-end developer (focused on user interfaces), a back-end developer (working on server-side logic), a full-stack developer (handling both front-end and back-end), or even a mobile app developer (specializing in mobile application development).
* Developers often collaborate with other team members, such as designers, testers, and project managers, to create complete software solutions.

## Web Development

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwanFw93TUQ" %}

Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites[^1] and [web applications](#user-content-fn-2)[^2].&#x20;

It involves a combination of tasks, including designing the user interface, writing code to implement functionality, and ensuring that the website functions smoothly across various devices and browsers.&#x20;

Web developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the front-end (client-side) of websites, while back-end developers work on server-side scripting, databases, and server configuration to handle data and user interactions.&#x20;

Web development encompasses both the visual aspects and the underlying technical infrastructure of websites, making them accessible and interactive on the internet.

{% hint style="info" %}
The common three languages you need to know are:

1. [**HTML**](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] --> this is a markup language _just like markdown_ and its purpose is to label and categorize the content written/placed on a web document for the browser to display.
2. [**CSS**](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] --> this is a language that is used to design the aesthetic of a webpage. It will be linked to an HTML page, and it will grab various elements and stylize such elements.
3. JavaScript --> this is a scripting language that gives websites functionality. Any time you would want a website to behave after an action, there must be a JavaScript code to support such behaviour under the hood.

## Cybersecurity & InfoSec

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b52cfb6lweU" %}

Cybersecurity and information security (InfoSec) both focus on protecting digital assets, but they have distinct scopes.&#x20;

Cybersecurity primarily deals with safeguarding systems, networks, and data from cyber threats, including malware, hacking, and unauthorized access.&#x20;

InfoSec, on the other hand, encompasses a broader perspective, emphasizing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all forms of information, whether in digital or physical formats.&#x20;

While both share the overarching goal of safeguarding information, cybersecurity tends to have a more technology-centric approach, whereas InfoSec encompasses a wider range of considerations, including policies, procedures, risk management, and physical security, alongside technical measures.&#x20;

Ultimately, both are critical components of an organization's efforts to maintain the security and privacy of its data and systems in an increasingly interconnected digital world.

## Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSW-5m8lRMs" %}

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer exciting and rapidly evolving career opportunities.&#x20;

AI involves creating intelligent systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and natural language understanding.&#x20;

Machine learning is a subset of AI, focused on training algorithms to recognize patterns and make predictions from data.&#x20;

Careers in AI and ML can span various domains, including research, software development, data science, and even specialized roles like AI ethics and AI strategy.&#x20;

Professionals in these fields work on cutting-edge technologies, tackle complex challenges, and have the potential to shape the future of industries ranging from healthcare and finance to autonomous vehicles and robotics. Continuous learning and staying updated with the latest advancements are essential for success in these dynamic and high-demand career paths.
