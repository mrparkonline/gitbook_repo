# Git & GitHub

[**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) and [**GitHub** ](https://github.com/)provide a robust version control system, facilitate collaboration and open-source development, offer backup and recovery mechanisms, and integrate with various tools to enhance the development workflow.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers manage and track changes to their source code and other files.&#x20;

It allows multiple people to collaborate on projects, making it easier to work together, keep track of changes, and revert to previous states if needed. Git maintains a history of changes, making it possible to understand who made what changes and when. It's widely used in software development but can also be applied to other types of projects where version control and collaboration are important.

> ### Git Repository
>
> In version control systems, a repository is a data structure that stores metadata for a set of files or directory structure.
>
> By creating a repository, you are creating a `/.git` folder in your coding project space.
>
> By using git, the folder will contain all the changes that has been made throughout your code. The changes throughout your code will create a revision history that you can revert back to.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses the Git version control system to facilitate collaboration on software development projects. It provides tools for hosting repositories of code, managing changes through Git, and enabling multiple developers to work together on the same project. GitHub offers features like issue tracking, pull requests, code review, and project management, making it a popular platform for open-source and private software development. It allows developers to share, contribute to, and collaborate on code and projects with a global community.

### How Git & GitHub helps a Development Project

1. Create a **"repository"** (project) with a git hosting tool.
2. Copy **(or clone)** the repository to your local machine
3. Add a file to your local repo and **"commit"** (save) the changes
4. **"Push"** your changes to your main branch
5. Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
6. **"Pull"** the changes to your local machine
7. Create a **"branch"** (version), make a change, commit the change
8. Open a **"pull request"** (propose changes to the main branch)
9. **"Merge"** your branch to the main branch
