# Generate all possible pairs of values

## Solution Breakdown

* If we have all pairs of values, we can create a sum from each pair to compare it with the target.
* The indices that generated the pair that totals to the target will be our answer

### Example of generating all possible sums

```
list = [2,7,11,15]

all sum pairs:
    2 + 7 = 9
    2 + 11 = 13
    2 + 15 = 17
    7 + 11 = 18
    7 + 15 = 22
    11 + 15 = 26
```

Depending what our target value is, the sum generated by each possible pair creates such numbers. As long as the target value is one of the results `(9, 13, 17, 18, 22, 26)`, we should be able to locate the two index values that adds up to the target.

## Python Solution

```python
def twoSum(array: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    answer = []
    
    for i in range(len(array)):
        left_operand = array[i]
        
        for j in range(i+1, len(array)):
            right_operand = array[j]
            
            if left_operand + right_operand == target:
                answer.append(i)
                answer.append(j)
                return answer
            # end of if
        # end of inner for
    # end of outer for
    
    # return empty list if solution not found
    return []
# end of twoSum()
```

### Code Explanation

```python
def twoSum(array: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
```

* The function `twoSum` is defined to take two arguments:
  * `array`: a list of integers.
  * `target`: an integer.
* The function returns a list of integers.

```python
answer = []
```

* An empty list `answer` is initialized to store the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target, if found.

```python
for i in range(len(array)):
    left_operand = array[i]
```

* This loop iterates through the array using index `i`.
* `left_operand` is set to the value at index `i` of the array.

```python
for j in range(i+1, len(array)):
    right_operand = array[j]
```

* This loop iterates through the array starting from `i+1` to avoid considering the same element twice and to avoid duplicates.
* `right_operand` is set to the value at index `j` of the array.

```python
if left_operand + right_operand == target:
    answer.append(i)
    answer.append(j)
    return answer
```

* The sum of `left_operand` and `right_operand` is checked against the `target`.
* If the sum equals the target, the indices `i` and `j` are appended to the `answer` list.
* The function returns the `answer` list immediately after finding the pair, as the problem typically asks for just one such pair.

```python
return []
```

* If no such pair is found after checking all possible pairs, the function returns an empty list.
