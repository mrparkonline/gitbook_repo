# Subtract each value from the target, see if the difference exists in the list

## Solution Breakdown

* Since a sum is a result of two operands added together, we can express it as -> `x + y = sum`
* By rearranging the equation, we can also express it as -> `y = sum - x`
* If we have the `sum` set to our given target value, and let `x` be represented by each individual values in our list, we can generate the `y` value
  * Each time we generate the `y` value, we can search the list if the `y` value exists in the list
  * If the value exists, the index of `x` and `y` will be our pair that generated our desired target value

### Example of looking at differences

```
list = [2,7,11,15]; target = 9

all possible differences:
    9 - 2 = 7
    9 - 7 = 2
    9 - 11 = -2
    9 - 15 = -6
```

Depending what our target value is, the sum generated by each possible pair creates such numbers. As long as the target value is one of the results `(9, 13, 17, 18, 22, 26)`, we should be able to locate the two index values that adds up to the target.

## Python Solution

```python
def twoSum(array: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    answer = []
    
    
    return []
# end of twoSum()
```
