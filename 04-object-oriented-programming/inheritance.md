# Inheritance

In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class (called the subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (called the superclass or base class). Inheritance is a key concept in OOP that facilitates code reuse and promotes the creation of a hierarchical structure for organizing and modeling software.

## Key Concepts of Inheritance

**Base Class (Superclass):** The class whose properties and behaviors are inherited by another class.

**Derived Class (Subclass):** The class that inherits from another class.

**Method Overriding:** The ability of a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.

**Code Reusability:** Inheritance promotes the reuse of code by allowing common functionality to be defined in a base class and shared among multiple subclasses.

**Hierarchy:** Inheritance enables the creation of a hierarchical structure of classes, where more specialized classes inherit from more general ones.
